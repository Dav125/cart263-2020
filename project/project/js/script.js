Project 1: Happiness is Sisyphus
Author Name: David Fong

This is a project that is about making a program
that is related to Sisyphus which is about a guy who is pushing
a boulder in a hill which the boulder keeps fall back down.
So the task is never ending which I have to create a project that
reflects the story of Sisyphus.
